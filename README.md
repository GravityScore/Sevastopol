Sevastopol
==========

Sevastopol is a top down action game. You must fight for survival, escaping the doomed space station.

The idea is a mix between Hotline Miami and the original Alien series (hence the name), featuring film-noir, Blade Runner-esque CRT monitor style art.

Controls are fairly simple:

* WASD to move
* Click to kill
* Mouse to aim
* Hold shift to look around

I really enjoyed making this! First game I've actually finished in an unreasonably long time. I'd love to know what you think, and thanks for playing it!

You might notice a few collision detection bugs, especially with the AI. The code is absolutely awful. I'm nervous about making it public because it's so damn awful. I didn't go about 5 minutes without copy and paste.

The game was written with [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) (using Lua). The source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/GravityScore/Sevastopol).
